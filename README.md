### Flutter Chat App 

this is also my college project. Simple chat app where u can login/register, send messages, search users and search messages.
app won't run if you don't specify FirebaseOptions() in main() method,
also it won't run if you don't add ```google-services.json``` (you have to create a new project in firebase then you can download this json file) into the ```.../android/app``` folder
